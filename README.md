# INav Cross configurator

### What is it?
The purpose of this pet project is to build a Inav compatible configurable app
that works on Mobile and Desktop cross platform.

### Why
Since Inav-configurator is great but a bit aging. I wanted to build something for fun as a pet project that i could also use to configure Inav using my mobile without bluetooth.

### Aims
* Work on all systems mobile and Desktop
* Allow configuration over USB-C on desktop and at least android devices
* Faster app
* Faster board handling
* Better error feedback to user
* More user friendly with extended help and step by step guides

### Current aims
- [X] Orientation informatin
- [ ] Cli
- [ ] Import dump
- [ ] Export dump
- [ ] Advanced params
- [ ] Modes
- [ ] Status
- [ ] Wizzards for model types. calibrations, Planes etc, default setups etc

### A LOT TO DO!
There is a lot to do to catchup and not everything will be implemented. Always use INav-configurator but hopefully over some years i may get close
and at least be able to configure what i need in the field.
